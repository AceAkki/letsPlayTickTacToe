# **Let's Play Tic-Tac-Toe**

A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built with **React**, using `useState`, `useEffect`, and `nanoid`. This app supports two-player gameplay, automatic win detection, and a responsive design for a smooth experience across devices.

## **Features**

- **Two-player Gameplay**: Play with a friend in alternating turns.
- **Automatic Win Detection**: The game detects when a player wins or if the game ends in a draw.
- **Responsive Design**: The game adjusts to all screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
- **State Management**: Uses React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for managing game state and player turns.
- **Unique Grid Cells**: Each square has a unique identifier generated by `nanoid`.
- **Game Reset**: A reset feature allows you to start a new game after a win or draw.

## **How to Play**

1. **Start the Game**: Visit the website and begin with an empty 3x3 grid.
2. **Enter Player Names**: Input usernames for players "X" and "O".
3. **Player Turns**: Players alternate placing their marks ("X" and "O") on the grid.
4. **Winning Condition**: The game automatically detects a win when a player aligns three of their marks either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
5. **Tie Condition**: If all squares are filled and there’s no winner, the game ends in a draw.
6. **Game Reset**: After a game ends, you can restart by refreshing the page or using the reset button.

## **Technologies Used**

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **useState**: React hook to manage game state (board, current player, winner).
- **useEffect**: React hook to handle side effects like switching players and checking for a winner.
- **nanoid**: A library for generating unique IDs, used to ensure each square in the grid has a unique key.
- **CSS**: For styling the grid and providing a responsive UI.

## **Code Overview**

- **App.js**: This is the main component, responsible for rendering the game board, managing game state (including the `spaces` array and the `users` array), and handling the player's turns. The component also includes functions to detect winners and handle game resets.
- **useState**: Used for managing the board state (`spaces`), the current users (`users`), and player turn management.
- **useEffect**: Triggered when a player makes a move to switch turns and check for a winner. It updates the `users` state to reflect the player whose turn it is.
- **Square Component**: Represents each individual square in the 3x3 grid. It receives props for the square’s type (empty, "X", or "O") and a click handler to place the player's mark.
- **Game Logic**: The `getWinner` function checks the win conditions, and the `gameCompletion` function checks for a draw when the board is full.

### **Key Game Logic**:
- **Turn Management**: The `useEffect` hook manages switching between players after each valid move.
- **Winner Detection**: The app uses pre-defined win conditions (rows, columns, diagonals) and checks if any of the current player’s marks form a winning combination.
- **Game Completion**: The game ends either when a player wins or when the board is full and no player has won (a draw).
